# rockyou-password-check

This is a small cli tool with python to check if your password was inside the RockYou2024.txt leaks.

## Prerequireties
- Python (I uses 3.12, no external dependencies)
- Download the RockYou2024.txt over [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bwandowando/common-password-list-rockyou2024-txt)
- Put the archive.zip into the root of the directory
I liked the version in kaggle the most because it was already structured in alphabets and numbers like this:

(Enter tree of kaggle)

## Start the application

Start the application with.
> ```python main.py```

Enter your password and wait :)
